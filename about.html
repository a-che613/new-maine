        <p>Our family fell in love with the Majestic Maine Coon breed when we welcomed Luna into our home a few years ago, we quickly learned one is never enough and she was quickly followed by her Half-Brother Storm,
          We wanted to bring the same joy our cats brought us to other families, which is why we decided to breed these beautiful cats.
          Our breeding cats live along side Luna and Storm in our home as they too are much loved members of our family. They enjoy the best of everything from homemade raw to snuggling on the sofa and days bird watching in the sunshine from the safety of their catio.
          The breeding chapter of our story began when Harley joined our family, followed by our Stud boy Kylo and Queen Elara. Our pride further grew when we added our stunning girl Maia followed by lovely Polly. Polly blessed us with 8 babies, some of which stayed with us to hopefully become Queens in the future
          We were delighted in spring 2020 when Harley and Kylo became parents to our first litter of three happy, healthy, big and beautiful kittens. Since then we have had more babies born in our home.
          We are registered with and members of The International Cat Association (TICA) We have also signed up to Tica's Voluntary Code of Ethics.
          Our breeding cats are Genetically Screened by Langford Diagnostic Services at the University of Bristol for the main 3 genetic diseases affecting the Maine Coon breed:
